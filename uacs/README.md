#Unified Accounts Code Structure

Last Update: 24 August 2014

This folder contains various machine-readable files taken from the [Unified Accounts Code Structure (UACS) Manual](http://pfm.gov.ph/files/uacs_manual.pdf).

Each data set will have a machine-readable file (either as .csv or .txt) and an accompanying description file in the form of Markdown (.md).

Limitations:

* Since the source code is in PDF format, we had to manually copy and paste data from the tables in the document.
