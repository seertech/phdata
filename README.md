# PHData

Last Update: 24 August 2014

## Motives
While the Philippine Government has started to encourage open access to data, not all of these can be processed readily by computers even if they are in digital form. We wish to get Philippine Open Data from various sources and make these machine-readable (e.g. CSV, JSON, XML, Tab-delimited).

This project is still in its early stages. No formal processes nor standards have been established. Meanwhile, these shall be our guiding principles:

1. Keep original data from source as raw as possible.

2. All cleansing and transformations must be reproducible from the raw source and must be documented as clearly as possible.

3. All changes to the data must have an audit trail.

4. Transformed and extracted data will be saved in new files and will not destruct original data files.

5. If useful data is already machine-readable from its source, there is no need to duplicate these in this repository. Instead, links to the origin shall be documented.
