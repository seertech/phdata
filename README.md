# PHData

Last Update: 24 August 2014

We wish to get Philippine Open Data from various sources and make these machine-readable (e.g. CSV, JSON, XML, Tab-delimited).

This project is still in its early stages. No formal processes nor standards have been established. Meanwhile, these shall be our guiding principles:

1. Keep data as raw as possible.

2. All cleansing and transformations must be reproducible from the raw source and must be documented as clearly as possible.

3. All changes to the data must have an audit trail.
